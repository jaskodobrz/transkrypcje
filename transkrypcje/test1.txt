It's been just three days since I posted this video of me sneaking onto Jeffrey Epstein's island. Every day since I've been home, there have been blacked out Escalade trucks sitting outside of my house. I'm not sure what they want or who they are, but I'm posting this here now just in case anything happens. For all I know, this could be Jeffrey Epstein's friends. If I pissed anyone off, I apologize, and I want this all to be over.
