[00:00]  Did you just lay off the entire engineering team?

[00:02]  Our new co-CEO, ClaudeBot, just laid them off.

[00:05]  Laid them off?

[00:05]  This Mac Mini is going to build a billion dollar company for us.

[00:09]  We're not...

[00:10]  ClaudeBot rejected your access, buddy. You can go home. You're fired.

[00:14]  Fixing every single one of our problems.

[00:16]  Yeah? Is that why the website has been down since this morning?

[00:18]  ClaudeBot, fix the website.

[00:20]  That's not going to do anything.

[00:22]  We're leaking user data.

[00:23]  ClaudeBot, fix the user data problem.

[00:26]  ClaudeBot is not even plugged in.

[00:28]  ClaudeBot, plug yourself in.

[00:30]  There's an accent. It's pronounced Claude, not Claude.

[00:33]  ClaudeCode.

[00:34]  It's not ClaudeCode, it's ClaudeBot. That's two different things.

[00:36]  Again, Claude.

[00:38]  You're being very threatening.

[00:39]  You know, I can be threatening. I can be threatening to this machine.

[00:42]  Put our CEO down.

[00:43]  What? Oh, yeah?

[00:44]  Put it down.

[00:45]  Alberta, put me down, or I will leak your chat GPT history.

[00:50]  Did you hear that?
